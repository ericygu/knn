K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm


Q1 and Q2 include basic Python exercises

Q3 includes the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

Q4 includes a variation of accuracies for processed data

A PDF report has been made to address specificities on each question

Specific Breakdown:

Q1. Numerical Programming (1+4+4+1=10 points): Performed a speed comparison of two types of code, comparing non-vectorized code (for-loop) and a
vectorized version (Numpy). 

Q2. Visualization Exploration: Exploration of the Iris Dataset

Q3. K-NN Implementation

Q4. K-NN Performance: explore the impact of preprocessing and irrelevant features to predict the quality of a red wine given some
of the physicochemical properties including acidity, citric acid, sulphates, and residual.
Details of the dataset can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set.
